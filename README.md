Scaffolded projects for processing using 2d data structs and OOP


**Topic and Learning Outcome:**

Object Oriented Programming and Design:
<http://www.learnalberta.ca/ProgramOfStudy.aspx?lang=en&ProgramId=74838#900020>

**Essential Question:**

What is the object-oriented paradigm and how does it shift the way we organize
our projects?

**Objectives:**

Encourage and scaffold abstraction and high level design in our planning using
object-oriented design and programming?

**Prior Knowledge:**

Procedural (functional or method-driven) Programming.

Data Structures (static, dynamic and multidimensional). – Code provided

**Scaffolded Practice:**

What is the OOP paradigm?

UML diagramming.

Template Code(s). (provided) – Key objective (move away from main class having
everything and encapsulate wherever possible. Ie. Main lets you choose what game
and then instantiate board with appropriate parameters rather than main creating
a data structure to store all of the info as per the Data Structures templates)
